  <h1> The Concept </h1>
  <p>So what does RootVision actually mean and what is the concept behind it? It is more than a concept, it is a program of two sides: planning and forming a career, and developing the skills needed to get there. These two sides, which we will explain in more detail below, are interlinked and one does not necessarily precede the other: some people start with the Vision, whilst others start with the Roots. Everyone has very different career experiences and our program is not meant to be a ‘one-fit-for-all’. Our resources are to be used for inspiration and motivation, helping you to think outside the box and open your eyes to the opportunities around you. </p>

    <h2 class="t1"> THE VISION </h2>
      <p class="vision">
        The vision encompasses two things: deciding which direction you want your career to go in and how best to get there. We encourage our members to try new things and gain more experience in order to decide what type of work and environment they like best. For example, if you are a student who is interested in a job in finance but have no experience of this, it is difficult to know for certain whether you will like it, and what exact role in this sector you would like best. Once you have the experience you will have a clearer vision, which is key to personal motivation. The ‘how best to get there’ part is about networking and finding opportunities.
      </p>
      <h2 class="t2"> THE ROOTS </h2>
      <p class="roots">
        The Roots stand for developing skills and as previously mentioned, the roots can come before or after the vision. Before the vision, you can develop generic skills such as project management or graphic design, which will help in any career. This ‘tasting’ of different areas will also help you form your vision. If you are developing your roots after vision, this entails understanding which specific skills are needed for your ideal job and making a plan to work your way up in that specific sector.

  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>In order to help you better understand the RootVision program, below is an example of a student who used our website… </p>
  <div id="grid" class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
          <img src="images/square1.jpeg" class="image">
          <p class="text">Step 1</p> <small>This student had no idea what they wanted to do after GCSE’s and so the first step was to chose 5 different interests/school subjects to try out. We have a quiz designed to help you narrow down your interests and chose 5 areas to explore. These 5 areas can be completely different as many people tend to have wide interests. One of the areas the student chose was finance.</small>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
          <img src="images/square2.jpeg" class="image">
          <div class="overlay">
          <p class="text">Step 2 <small>The next step was finding out how to explore this area through experience. When trying out an area, especially if you are a student, it is easier to start close to home. This could be seeing if a relative works in this area and asking them to do an hour explaining to you what exactly they do, or going to school and asking if you could do a weeks work experience helping the finance department, or finding a local shop and asking for a Saturday job. </small></p>
          </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
          <img src="images/square3.jpeg" class="image">
          <div class="overlay">
          <p class="text">Step 3</p> <small>This student was unsuccessful finding these particular opportunities so instead decided to learn how to create personal finance excel spreadsheets, searched on google and Youtube for people who work in the finance sector, and used our resource which outlines different job titles in different sectors. They found that they really enjoyed excel and managing money, and found a particular job that interested them: a Bank Manager. </small>
          </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <img src="images/square4.jpeg" class="image">
        <div class="overlay">
        <p class="text">Step 4</p> <small>The next stage was making the vision clearer by working out exactly how to get there. Your dream job will normally come after different job titles, so this student used our pathway tree tool to map out the other job titles they might have to pass by to become a manager, for example bank cashier and assistant manager. Their pathway tree also included qualifications they might need to get or which will make them stand out amongst the competition. </small>

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <img src="images/square5.jpeg" class="image">
        <div class="overlay">
        <p class="text">Step 5</p> <small>This tree pathway will help you to chose your education options, for example A Level/College/University/Apprenticeship options. The student decided to take Maths, Business and Politics for A Levels. He also took online courses, such as on the website FutureLearn, relating to bank management. </small>

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <img src="images/square6.jpeg" class="image">
        <div class="overlay">
        <p class="text">Step 6</p> <small>In order to gain new skills, the student contacted all the local banks asking to do either a Saturday job or a summer internship. They were successful and this enabled them to create new contacts as well. In order to build more contacts, the student followed bank managers on LinkedIn and messaged them for career advice. </small>

  <p> This example, despite not being comprehensive, gives an idea of how the RootVision program can help you with your career journey and general skill development. It also shows how opportunities can be difficult to find, and so being proactive, determined and expanding your search is essential. Start your RootVision plan today! </p>
