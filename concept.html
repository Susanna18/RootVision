  <h1> The Concept </h1>
  <p>So what does RootVision actually mean and what is the concept behind it? It is more than a concept, it is a program of two sides: planning and forming a career, and developing the skills needed to get there. These two sides, which we will explain in more detail below, are interlinked and one does not necessarily precede the other: some people start with the Vision, whilst others start with the Roots. Everyone has very different career experiences and our program is not meant to be a ‘one-fit-for-all’. Our resources are to be used for inspiration and motivation, helping you to think outside the box and open your eyes to the opportunities around you. </p>

    <h2 class="t1"> THE VISION </h2>
      <p class="vision">
        The vision encompasses two things: deciding which direction you want your career to go in and how best to get there. We encourage our members to try new things and gain more experience in order to decide what type of work and environment they like best. For example, if you are a student who is interested in a job in finance but have no experience of this, it is difficult to know for certain whether you will like it, and what exact role in this sector you would like best. Once you have the experience you will have a clearer vision, which is key to personal motivation. The ‘how best to get there’ part is about networking and finding opportunities.
      </p>
      <h2 class="t2"> THE ROOTS </h2>
      <p class="roots">
        The Roots stand for developing skills and as previously mentioned, the roots can come before or after the vision. Before the vision, you can develop generic skills such as project management or graphic design, which will help in any career. This ‘tasting’ of different areas will also help you form your vision. If you are developing your roots after vision, this entails understanding which specific skills are needed for your ideal job and making a plan to work your way up in that specific sector.
